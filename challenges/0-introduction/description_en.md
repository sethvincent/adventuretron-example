# Welcome to the adventure

Adventuretron is a tool for creating self-guided workshops that run as desktop apps on MacOS, Windows, & Linux.

The main dependencies of Adventuretron are [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) & [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo).

## Work in progress

We're still early in the development of Adventuretron. There are weird APIs and messy rough edges. That's why we're making this workshop: with the hope that you'll try this out, and let us know what makes sense, what was easy, what was challenging, and what was ridiculously wrong.

## Features
- i18n support
- cross-platform desktop apps
- make workshops for any topic, not just code
